 * 
 * Follow up for "Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array":
 * What if duplicates are allowed?
 * Would this affect the run-time complexity? How and why?
 *
 * Suppose a sorted array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.
 * 
 * (i.e., 0 1 2 4 5 6 7 might become 4 5 6 7 0 1 2).
 * 
 * Find the minimum element.
 * 
 * The array may contain duplicates.

 * Solution
 * 
 * For case where AL == AM == AR, the minimum could be on AMâ€™s left or right
 * side (eg, [1, 1, 1, 0, 1] or [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]). In this case, we could not
 * discard either subarrays and therefore such worst case degenerates to the
