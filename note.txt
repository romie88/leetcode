- Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array
	binary search the pivot

- Maximum Product Subarray
	dynamic programming tracking both max postive and min negative product ending at the current index	

- Reverse Words in a String
	after the loop of breaking up the input string into words, don't forget to process the remaining of the input string.

- Evaluate Reverse Polish Notation
	for operator - and /, pay attention to the order of the operands from the stack.

- Max Points on a Line
	dont forget duplication

- Sqrt(x)
	binary search (not trivial); watch out that mid * mid overflow
	Newton iteration method

- Valid Number
	finite automata
	direct

- String to Integer (atoi)
	watch out the overflow/underflow

- Roman to Integer
- Integer to Roman

- Reverse Integer
	cannot overcome the overflow issue happening when i == INT_MIN and i = -i because -INT_MIN cannot be represented in int
	note that % operator in C++ has some implemenation defined behavior when one of the operands is negative

- Pow(x,n)
	recursive call pow( x, n ) but half of n but with x * x!!!

- Plus One
	when iterating through std::vector by index, be careful using std::vector< T >::size_type, as it is unsigned, looping from size() - 1 down to 0 is infinite!!!

- Permutation Sequence
	not comfortable with have an std::vector to keep all the numbers but erase them one by one in a loop which is O(n^2)

-  Palindrome Number
	OJ decides negative numbers are not palindrome number
